**What you'll learn**: How to load images, select colors, and copy color codes

## What You'll Need

- Enhanced Color Picker installed
- Any image file (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- A text editor or design software to test color codes

## Step 1: Launch and Load an Image

1. **Open Enhanced Color Picker**
   - Double-click the application icon
   - The interface opens with a dark theme by default

2. **Load your first image**
   - **Method A**: Drag and drop an image file onto the canvas
   - **Method B**: Click **File** â†’ **Load Image** and browse for a file
   - **Method C**: Press **Ctrl+O** and select an image

3. **Verify the image loaded**
   - Your image appears in the main canvas area
   - Image information shows in the status bar
   - The image automatically fits to the canvas size

## Step 2: Basic Color Selection

1. **Move your mouse over the image**
   - Notice the coordinates display (X, Y) in the status bar
   - The cursor changes to a crosshair over the image

2. **Click to select a color**
   - Click anywhere on the image
   - The **Color Panel** on the right updates with color information
   - You'll see the color in multiple formats

3. **Understanding the Color Panel**
   - **Color swatch**: Visual preview of the selected color
   - **RGB values**: Red, Green, Blue (0-255)
   - **HEX code**: Web-friendly format (#RRGGBB)
   - **HSL values**: Hue, Saturation, Lightness
   - **HSV values**: Hue, Saturation, Value
   - **CMYK values**: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (print colors)

## Step 3: Copying Color Codes

1. **Copy a single format**
   - Click the **copy button** (ðŸ“‹) next to any color format
   - The color code is copied to your clipboard
   - A brief confirmation appears

2. **Test the copied color**
   - Open a text editor
   - Paste (Ctrl+V) to see the color code
   - Example: `#FF8000` for an orange color

3. **Copy in programming formats**
   - Right-click on the color swatch
   - Select **"Copy as..."** for programming language formats:
     - CSS: `color: #FF8000;`
     - Python: `(255, 128, 0)`
     - JavaScript: `"#FF8000"`

## Step 4: Precision Color Selection

1. **Zoom in for accuracy**
   - Use your **mouse wheel** to zoom in
   - Or press **Ctrl+Plus** to zoom in
   - Zoom in until you can see individual pixels clearly

2. **Use the pixel grid**
   - At high zoom levels (800%+), a pixel grid appears automatically
   - This helps you select exact pixels
   - Toggle grid: **View** â†’ **Show Pixel Grid**

3. **Navigate zoomed images**
   - **Right-click and drag** to pan around the image
   - **Arrow keys** for fine movement
   - **Ctrl+0** to fit the image back to screen

## Step 5: Working with Multiple Colors

1. **Select multiple colors**
   - Click on different parts of your image
   - Each selection updates the Color Panel
   - Previous colors are automatically added to **History Panel**

2. **View color history**
   - Look at the **History Panel** (usually on the left)
   - See all recently selected colors
   - Click any color in history to reselect it

3. **Clear history if needed**
   - Right-click in the History Panel
   - Select **"Clear History"**
   - Confirm when prompted

## Step 6: Save Your Work

1. **Add colors to a palette**
   - After selecting a color, click **"Add to Palette"**
   - The color appears in the **Palette Panel**
   - Repeat for other colors you want to keep

2. **Save your palette**
   - Click **File** â†’ **Save Palette**
   - Choose a location and filename
   - Your palette is saved for future use

## Practice Exercise

Try this exercise to practice your new skills:

1. **Load a colorful image** (a photo, logo, or artwork)
2. **Select 5 different colors** from various parts of the image
3. **Copy each color in HEX format** and paste into a text file
4. **Create a palette** with these 5 colors
5. **Save the palette** with a descriptive name

## Tips for Success

- **Start with high-contrast images** for easier color identification
- **Use zoom liberally** - it's the key to precision
- **Experiment with different color formats** to find what works for your workflow
- **Save palettes frequently** to build your color library
- **Practice with different image types** - photos, graphics, logos

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not zooming enough**: Always zoom in for precise selection
- **Ignoring the pixel grid**: Use it for exact pixel targeting
- **Forgetting to save palettes**: Save your work regularly
- **Not checking different formats**: Explore RGB, HSL, etc. for different uses
